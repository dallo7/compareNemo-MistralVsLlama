This Dash application provides a side-by-side comparison of two Large Language Models (LLMs):

* **Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct**
* **Mistral-Nemo**

Users can input text, receive inferences from both models, and provide feedback to help improve their performance.

## Features

* **Interactive Interface:** User-friendly Dash interface for seamless model comparison.
* **Real-time Inference:**  Get prompt results from both LLMs instantly.
* **Feedback Collection:**  Users can rate outputs to contribute to reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).
* **Data Export:** Export feedback data for further analysis.

## Technologies Used

* **Dash:**  Core framework for building the interactive web application.
* **Dash Bootstrap Components:** For styling and layout enhancements.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and storage of feedback.
* **Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct & Mistral-Nemo:** The Large Language Models being compared.
* **Gradio Client:**  Potentially for integrating with Gradio for model inference (if used in your `models.py`).
